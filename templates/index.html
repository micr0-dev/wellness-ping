                    <strong>What this is:</strong> Regular email check-ins. If
                    you don't respond, your emergency contacts get notified.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Who it's for:</strong> Activists, journalists,
                    researchers, solo folks. Anyone who needs someone to notice
                    if they go silent.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>How it works:</strong> Choose daily or weekly pings.
                    Click the link in the email or reply "PONG" to confirm
                    you're okay. Miss the ping? We'll send reminders. Still no
                    response? Your emergency contacts get alerted.
